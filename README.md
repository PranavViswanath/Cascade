## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```
   pip install streamlit PyPDF2 openai
   ```
3. **Set your Perplexity API key** in the script or as an environment variable
4. **Run the app:**  
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
5. **Open the provided URL** and upload a research PDF or paste a claim

## How It Works

- **Upload a paper** or **enter a research claim** to investigate
- The system uses real-time web search to **find papers that may contradict your claim**
- For each significant paper found, it **maps out the discussion or impact** by searching for follow-up articles, blog posts, and discussions
- **Synthesizes clear, direct advice** for researchers—highlighting major tensions in the field and suggesting 2–3 focused next steps for future research
